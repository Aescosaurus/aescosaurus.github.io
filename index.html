					<p>
						Platformer where you use slingshot movement to collect the crystals.
						My most ambitious project to date, having spent nearly two years in development it offers lots of mechanics and gameplay.
						Though most of that time this project was on the backburner while working on school or other projects.
						Developed in C++ using the Chili DirectX framework, with help from a musician and several testers.
						Started 12-14-2018, released on 11-4-2020
