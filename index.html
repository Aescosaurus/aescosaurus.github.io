					<h2><a href="https://aescosaurus.itch.io/ch" target="_blank">Crystal Hopper</a></h2>
					<p>
						Platformer where you use slingshot movement to collect the crystals.
						My most ambitious project to date, having spent nearly two years in development it offers lots of mechanics and gameplay.
						Though most of that time this project was on the backburner while working on school or other projects.
						Developed in C++ using the Chili DirectX framework, with help from a musician and several testers.
						Started 12-14-2018, released on 11-4-2020.

					<h2><a href="https://aescosaurus.itch.io/dungeon-brawler" target="_blank">Dungeon Brawler</a></h2>
					<p>
						Arcade bullet hell local co-op dungeon crawler.
						A lot of time was spent tweaking player controls, balancing difficulty scaling, and making juicy interactions.
						Being my first released game built using GameMaker, I was still grappling with the software so I learned a lot along the way.
						Started 12-18-2019, released on 5-30-2020.
