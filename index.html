					<h2><a href="https://aescosaurus.itch.io/ch">Crystal Hopper</a></h2>
					<p>
						Platformer where you use slingshot movement to collect the crystals.
						My most ambitious project to date, having spent nearly two years in development it offers lots of mechanics and gameplay.
						Though most of that time this project was on the backburner while working on school or other projects.
						Developed in C++ using the Chili DirectX framework, with help from a musician and several testers.
						Started 12-14-2018, released on 11-4-2020.

					<p>
						Arcade bullet hell local co-op dungeon crawler.
						A lot of time was spent tweaking player controls, balancing difficulty scaling, and making juicy interactions.
						Being my first released game built using GameMaker, I was still grappling with the software so I learned a lot along the way.
						Started 12-18-2019, released on 5-30-2020.

					<h2><a href="https://aescosaurus.itch.io/puzzle-tiles">Puzzle Tiles</a></h2>
					<p>
						Top down puzzle/relaxation game.
						I wanted to make a game using my favorite "tile graphics" since I haven't done one like this in a while.
						It started out as an action game with a light/fog of war mechanic, which ended up repurposed for the final version.
						I was taking a level design class at the time so I used this project to apply what I was learning there.
						Additionally I made it a priority since it was such a small scale project to make the code as clean as possible.
						Development started on January 17th, 2020, and released on February 21, 2020.

						Made in a few days for the ScoreSpace Jam with the theme of combining.
						I initially had trouble with the theme but eventually settled on an idea I was happy with.
						Made with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
