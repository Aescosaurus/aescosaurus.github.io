				<h2>Special Skills</h2>
				<h3>C++ Programming and Game Development</h3>
				<p>
					I started following a series of tutorials to learn C++ all the way back in 2017 when I was still in high school.
					Since then I have kept working to improve this skill, developing countless apps and game prototypes, some of which I ended up releasing on itch.io.
					Despite learning various other languages and tools, this remains my favorite language to code in as I find it easy to fall into the flow state when working.
				</p>

				<h3>Unity/C# Game Development</h3>
				<p>
					Before coming to university I had only worked with Unity a little bit and played around making various prototype projects.
					I have ended up learning lots about this software as a result of many classes requiring using it, so I certainly consider it a strength now.
				</p>

				<h3>Javascript Game/Web Development</h3>
				<p>
					I have enjoyed playing around with web development since middle school, where I made simple websites and flash games.
					Later I followed an online course teaching basic JavaScript game development, and from there I started making games and participating in game jams.
					In high school I participated in a regional occupation program focusing on information technology where I went to learn lots about web development and working in Unix.
					During this time we explored all sorts of web technology like HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, using these to complete a project, mine was a painting app where you could draw and upload art, then view and rate other's works.
					Since then I have continued using JavaScript and HTML5 to develop games, it is especially fun using this in game jams.
				</p>

				<h3>Python Development</h3>
				<p>
					I have worked with Python on and off over the years, my use being limited to small automation tasks and simple games.
					While taking a computer science class specializing on Python I learned a lot about the language and all the features that differentiate it from traditional C languages.
					After this I took another class on AI in games, where we used exclusively Python to create intelligent behavior.
				</p>

				<h3>GameMaker Studio 2</h3>
				<p>
					This is another software I have learned to use in university.
					We are required to use this software for two classes, where we made games during the semester.
					I enjoy learning more about this tool and have made several games with it outside of school.
