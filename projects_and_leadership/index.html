				<h2>Demonstration of Team Projects</h2>
				<h3>Game Design Team: Miner Inconvenience</h3>
				<p>
					Worked on a team over the course of three semesters to prototype, develop, and release the tool based aerial platformer Miner Inconvenience.
					In the first semester we worked in teams of around four to develop a prototype a week, all in all completing five prototypes.
					We picked one of our prototypes from the previous weeks to develop further for another week, and we picked one of those to develop as the final game.
					In the second semester the entire class of around thirty focused on development on the same idea, with the class split in two feature teams.
					The final semester our count was reduced to less than ten individuals, and was where we drilled down on the core game mechanic and filled out the game, as well as polishing it, releasing marketing materials, and eventually publishing on itch.io.
					Check out the game <a href="https://rabidtrollstudios.itch.io/miner-inconvenience">here</a>!

				<h3>Game Design Team: Avarice</h3>
				<p>
					This is the same class as I took for Miner Inconvenience, but I only took the third semester working on this one.
					After hearing about the project from a friend I wanted to be a part of this which is why I ended up retaking the class.
					Compared to the last time I took this class there are more members, around 15, so the class is now split into two feature teams.
					It has been a great learning opportunity to work on another game with a team of this size.
					Look forward to the game's release, coming soon!

				<h3>Computer Science Team: Python</h3>
				<p>
					This was a computer science special topics course focusing on learning Python and using it for a project.
					Our team which comprised three individuals set our goal to develop an AI that could learn to play a video game using machine learning.
					I focused on developing the QTable machine learning system, while the other team members worked on tracking objects on screen and graphing performance.

				<h2>Demonstration of Leadership</h2>

				<h3>Innovation Team Lead</h3>
				<p>
					I was a leader on an innovation team for a project to develop marketing materials and prepare the client's app for re-release.
					The app release ended up being delayed accounting for global events, but our team completed the app upgrades and prepared marketing items to be released beyond the end of the project.
					The app can be found <a href="https://www.bytebreakstudios.com/signalflow.html">here</a>.
