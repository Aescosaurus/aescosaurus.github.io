			<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
			<p>My name is Michael Buslik.  I make learning and personal development fundamental priorities in my life.  More recently I have been directing attention on practicing learning Japanese, improving at digital art, and building furniture.  While some say these skills possess limited application on their own, it is the building up of knowledge and intense focus required to improve at such skills that yields reward.</p>
			<p>It was not always like this, though.  Throughout my life I often tended towards the path which offered the least resistance for the most satisfaction; playing video games instead of finishing homework, always scraping by to get the bare minimum in whatever I did.  This changed somewhere halfway through high school, where I decided to use internet resources to teach myself programming, and so I began a long, and difficult, but rewarding journey.</p>
			<p>My fascination with making games persisted since a young age, where I made board games during summer camp and made others play them with me.  In my mind, learning programming was the only way I would become able to produce the games that I dreamt about making.  By the time I graduated high school, I had obtained a proficiency in programming which would have matched my peers now, as I am about to graduate university.  Since that moment my life has been consumed by developing and releasing games, where I constantly had several projects in progress or had been participating in a game jam.</p>
			<p>In the past I ended up spending a lot of time wasting my time, where I now focus on productivity to the maximum degree possible.  I schedule my time each day hour by hour, using free time as a chance to improve at the current skill or hobby I am exploring.  I think this is the best way to spend one’s time, and the most effective way to move forward in life.</p>
