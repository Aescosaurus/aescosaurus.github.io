			<h2>What is the Bachelor of Innovation?</h2>
			<p>
				Many individuals ask what it means to be a student in the Bachelor of Innovation program.  Like topics as broad as science or arts, innovation encompasses a diverse quantity of fields, bringing together multi-talented teams for the purpose of transforming their ideas into an impact on the world.  Individuals studying topics varying from business to education to video game design congregate through the innovation program, and it is at this crossroad where the spark of innovation is born.  Only by collecting individuals with such unique skill sets and perspectives can we progress forward.

				<h2>Demonstration of Team Projects</h2>
				<h3>Game Design Team: Miner Inconvenience</h3>
				<p>
					Worked on a team over the course of three semesters to prototype, develop, and release the tool based aerial platformer Miner Inconvenience.
					In the first semester we worked in teams of around four to develop a prototype a week, all in all completing five prototypes.
					We picked one of our prototypes from the previous weeks to develop further for another week, and we picked one of those to develop as the final game.
					In the second semester the entire class of around thirty focused on development on the same idea, with the class split in two feature teams.
					The final semester our count was reduced to less than ten individuals, and was where we drilled down on the core game mechanic and filled out the game, as well as polishing it, releasing marketing materials, and eventually publishing on itch.io.
					Check out the game <a href="https://rabidtrollstudios.itch.io/miner-inconvenience">here</a>!

				</p>

				<h3>Game Design Team: Avarice</h3>
				<p>
					This is the same class as I took for Miner Inconvenience, but I only took the third semester working on this one.
					After hearing about the project from a friend I wanted to be a part of this which is why I ended up retaking the class.
					Compared to the last time I took this class there are more members, around 15, so the class is now split into two feature teams.
					It has been a great learning opportunity to work on another game with a team of this size.
					Look forward to the game's release, coming soon!
				</p>
				
				<h3>Computer Science Team: Python</h3>
				<p>
					This was a computer science special topics course focusing on learning Python and using it for a project.
					Our team which comprised three individuals set our goal to develop an AI that could learn to play a video game using machine learning.
					I focused on developing the QTable machine learning system, while the other team members worked on tracking objects on screen and graphing performance.

				<h2>Demonstration of Leadership</h2>

				<h3>Innovation Team Lead</h3>
				<p>
					I was a leader on an innovation team for a project to develop marketing materials and prepare the client's app for re-release.
					The app release ended up being delayed accounting for global events, but our team completed the app upgrades and prepared marketing items to be released beyond the end of the project.
					The app can be found <a href="https://www.bytebreakstudios.com/signalflow.html">here</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Special Skills</h2>
				<h3>C++ Programming and Game Development</h3>
				<p>
					I started following a series of tutorials to learn C++ all the way back in 2017 when I was still in high school.
					Since then I have kept working to improve this skill, developing countless apps and game prototypes, some of which I ended up releasing on itch.io.
					Despite learning various other languages and tools, this remains my favorite language to code in as I find it easy to fall into the flow state when working.
				</p>

				<h3>Unity/C# Game Development</h3>
				<p>
					Before coming to university I had only worked with Unity a little bit and played around making various prototype projects.
					I have ended up learning lots about this software as a result of many classes requiring using it, so I certainly consider it a strength now.
				</p>

				<h3>Javascript Game/Web Development</h3>
				<p>
					I have enjoyed playing around with web development since middle school, where I made simple websites and flash games.
					Later I followed an online course teaching basic JavaScript game development, and from there I started making games and participating in game jams.
					In high school I participated in a regional occupation program focusing on information technology where I went to learn lots about web development and working in Unix.
					During this time we explored all sorts of web technology like HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, using these to complete a project, mine was a painting app where you could draw and upload art, then view and rate other's works.
					Since then I have continued using JavaScript and HTML5 to develop games, it is especially fun using this in game jams.
				</p>

				<h3>Python Development</h3>
				<p>
					I have worked with Python on and off over the years, my use being limited to small automation tasks and simple games.
					While taking a computer science class specializing on Python I learned a lot about the language and all the features that differentiate it from traditional C languages.
					After this I took another class on AI in games, where we used exclusively Python to create intelligent behavior.
				</p>

				<h3>GameMaker Studio 2</h3>
				<p>
					This is another software I have learned to use in university.
					We are required to use this software for two classes, where we made games during the semester.
					I enjoy learning more about this tool and have made several games with it outside of school.
